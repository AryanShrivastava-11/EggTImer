# EggTimer
  EggTimer is a very simple iOS app which works on both landscape and portrait mode. The app can run on any iPhone which supports iOS 14.
  
  The app allows user to set the timer. After the timer is set, the progress bar shows the progress and an alarm is fired as soon as the timer is invalidated.
